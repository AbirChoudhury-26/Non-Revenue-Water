        <h3>What actually causes NRW (Non-Revenued Water)?</h3>
        <p>The reasons for water losses are many, ranging from leakages, pipe bursts, and poor water management to illegal connections and unauthorised consumption.
            But luckily, so are the available solutions - and their benefits.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h3>How severe is NRW actually is?</h3>
        <p>The global volume of NRW has been estimated to be 346 million cubic metres per day or 126 billion cubic metres per year.
            Conservatively valued at only USD 0.31 per cubic metre, the cost/value of water lost amounts to USD 39 billion per year.
            Not only is this an enormous financial concern, but elevated NRW also detracts from water utilities, in a time of increasing scarcity and climate change, 
            from reaching their goals of full service coverage, at a reliable level of service at an affordable price.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h3>How many loses can we have in water distribution networks?</h3>
        <p>In water distribution networks there are commercial loses and real losses.
            ->The commercial//apparent losses could be further broken to:
            a)meter reading errors
            b)meter under-registration
            c)Water-theft
            d)Water-accounting errors
            
            ->Then these Real//leakage losses could be further broken to:
            a)unreported bursts.
            b)background leakage.
            c)leakage and overflows from the utility's reservoirs and storage tanks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h3>what is non revenew water ?</h3>
        <p>NRW can occur through physical losses from leaking and broken pipes, which are caused by poor operations and maintenance, the lack of active leakage control, and poor quality of underground assets.</p>
